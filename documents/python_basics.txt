Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Variables and Data Types
Python has several built-in data types: integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), booleans (bool), lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly.

Functions
Functions in Python are defined using the 'def' keyword. They can accept positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default parameter values. Python also supports lambda functions for creating small anonymous functions.

Control Flow
Python uses if/elif/else statements for conditional execution. For loops iterate over sequences, while loops repeat as long as a condition is true. Python also provides list comprehensions for creating lists in a concise way.

Error Handling
Python uses try/except blocks for error handling. You can catch specific exceptions or use a general except clause. The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception occurred. Custom exceptions can be created by inheriting from the Exception class.
