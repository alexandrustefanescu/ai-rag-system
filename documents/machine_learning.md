# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, these systems improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. It maps input features to known output labels. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Use cases include spam detection, image classification, and price prediction.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns or structure in the data without explicit guidance. Common techniques include clustering (K-means, DBSCAN), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE), and association rules.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time. Applications include game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Engineering**: The process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem.
- **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. Regularization and cross-validation help mitigate this.
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: A fundamental concept where reducing bias increases variance and vice versa. The goal is to find the right balance.
- **Cross-Validation**: A technique for evaluating model performance by splitting data into training and validation sets multiple times.
